The idea is that when you are in public and you notice someone doing something nice, or having a bad day, or you're attracted to someone, you hand them a card. There are specific cards to hand out depending on the situation. <a class='pic-overlay' href='images/Portfolio/iNoticed/iNoticed_Card_Demo.gif'><img class='iNoticed-img' src='images/Portfolio/iNoticed/iNoticed_Card_Demo.gif' alt='iNoticed Home Page Demo'></a> The dating section is a full-blown dating app - you hand a card to someone you'd like to date and they visit the website to check out your profile and message you. It makes it easier to approach people. <br /> I created every aspect of the site using JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, SCSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, particles.js, XML, AJAX, MySQL/SQL, Git, Bash, Python, and zippopotam.us.<br /> This web app is still a work in progress, but feel free to <a class='ext-link' href='https://inoticed.org' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>visit it here</a>.<br /> iNoticed's repo has been added to <a class='ext-link' href='https://github.com/The-Natalie' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Github here</a>.</p>"

        rollInfo: "<p>BitLathe was a small business (it closed in October 2019) that provided custom web applications and content management services for clients. There were multiple websites and web apps that were already created when I joined BitLathe, and I was asked to update and maintain them. So, the majority of my work was tweaking old code, but I also added a lot of my own code, too. I also had a few projects I wrote from scratch.<br /> Unfortunately, the content of the projects I worked on while at BitLathe is confidential, so only descriptions of my projects can be shared. Here are a few of them:</p> <ul id='gallery' style='list-style: none;'> <li><a href='images/Portfolio/Bitlathe/RI_Demo.gif'><img src='images/Portfolio/Bitlathe/RI_Demo.gif' alt='Retirement Interactive Demo' /></a> <b><a class='ext-link' href='http://www.retirementinteractive.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Riversource Retirement Interactive</a></b> is the largest web app I've worked on. I helped update graphs and information, create new pages, and implement new designs requested by the client. While my boss created the application a couple years ago, I've put a lot of time and new code into much of it. The majority of my JavaScript experience came from working on this application.<br /> Languages used: JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS(SCSS) </li>  <br />  <li><a href='images/Portfolio/Bitlathe/CMID_Home.png'><img src='images/Portfolio/Bitlathe/CMID_Home.png' alt='Twitter and Instagram feeds on home page' /></a><b>Instagram Feed Widget -</b> A client wanted an Instagram feed on their home page that matched the Twitter feed that was already there. Unlike most social media platforms, Instagram doesn't provide a way to embed a feed(or multiple posts), they only provide embedded code for a single specified post. So, after explaining to the client how to retrieve their Instagram access token, I used the plugin Instafeed.js to create the widget. Everything looked fine, except the images and text weren't posting. Turns out the client's firewall was blocking Instagram, which made Instafeed.js useless. So, my boss wrote a server script that calls the 12 most recent Instagram posts to the API, and puts it in a file on the server every 10 minutes. I had to write new code that would parse through that information and output the appropriate HTML for the widget. I also updated the CSS to match the Twitter feed.<br /> Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Mustache.js, Instafeed.js, Instagram's API</li> <br /> <li><a href='images/Portfolio/Bitlathe/CMID_Popup.png'><img src='images/Portfolio/Bitlathe/CMID_Popup.png' alt='File not available pop-up' /></a><b>Turn Off Links with Pop-up -</b> A client's website had multiple files that were updated quarterly, but sometimes the files would expire before they were able to update them. Instead of removing the links and code for hundreds of files only to have to rewrite them a few days later, a flag was created within in the links so that the link was disabled and a message would pop-up to let the visitor know that the file is being updated. If the 'data-available' attribute within the link HTML code equaled '0', the link was disabled and a pop-up message was created, which came from the 'data-message' attribute. As a backup, if the 'data-message' attribute was left blank, there was a default message included in the JavaScript code. If the 'data-available' attribute equaled '0', the link worked normally. The image to the left is an example of the pop-up message. <br /> Languages used: HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery</li> <br /> <li><a href='images/Portfolio/Bitlathe/CMID_Video_page.gif'><img id='video-gif' src='images/Portfolio/Bitlathe/CMID_Video_page.gif' alt='Video page example when play button is clicked' /></a><b>Video Landing Page -</b> A client wanted a video page that contained all the elements and information about the video, including a transcript and other relevant files. When the page loaded, they wanted a still image from the video and a pronounced play button in the middle. They also wanted a block of text to obstruct part of the video, but when the play button is clicked, they wanted the block of text to slide down below the video. A rough draft of this page already existed, but I still had A LOT of changes to make, including totally customizing the video controls. This project involved extensive coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and a lot of research on embedded video players. To the left is an animated GIF of the video page showing how the block of code slides down when the play button is clicked.<br /> Languages/software used: HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Mozilla's Full Screen API, Photoshop, jPlayer</li> </ul> </div>"
