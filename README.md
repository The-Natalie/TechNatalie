This is my portfolio website. It was originally created from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, with a mobile first approach. After learning React, I decided to redo the site using React, JavaScript/JSX, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Babel, React-Tag-Cloud, RandomColor, and React-Animate-On-Scroll using Animations.css.
